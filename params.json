{"name":"CS 4641 ML Project","tagline":"","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nWe were able to obtain a [dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) consisting of emails from Enron management. There are 150 people represented, most of whom have sent hundreds of messages. We will restrict ourselves to sent emails and cut out all email headers and any quoted reply message. We will then randomize all proper names in the email to prevent the algorithm from just reading the signature.\r\n\r\n## Potential Results\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nEmail's short messages present a challenge to determining authorship. Nevertheless, personal experience indicates that the problem is tractable - one of the authors can distinguish his emails from his father's by counting ellipses. A reliable method to flag if an email was not written by its claimed author could provide another layer of security against identity theft.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nCohen, W. W.
